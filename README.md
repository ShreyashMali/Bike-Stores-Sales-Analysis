üìä Project Overview

This project involves a deep dive into the sales database of a chain of bicycle stores. Using MySQL, I performed exploratory data analysis to uncover key business insights related to sales 

performance, customer behavior, product trends, and store operations. The goal was to transform raw data into actionable intelligence to support strategic decision-making.

üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies
Database: MySQL

IDE: MySQL Workbench (or any SQL client)

Data Visualization: (Optional: e.g., Tableau, Excel for charting results)

üìà Key Business Questions Answered
This analysis was designed to answer critical questions for the business:

What is the overall revenue and sales volume?

Who are our most valuable customers?

Which product categories and brands are the most profitable?

What are the sales trends over time?

How does performance vary across different stores?

What are our top-selling products?

üîç SQL Analysis & Insights
I used the following SQL queries to extract meaningful insights from the bike_stores table.

1. Overall Performance Snapshot
sql
SELECT 
    SUM(revenue) AS total_revenue,
    SUM(total_units) AS total_units
FROM bike_stores;
üü¢ Insight: Established the total scale of the business, providing a baseline for all other metrics.

2. Identifying High-Value Customers
sql
SELECT 
    customers,
    SUM(revenue) AS total_spent
FROM bike_stores
GROUP BY customers
ORDER BY total_spent DESC
LIMIT 10;
üü¢ Insight: Identified the top 10 customers by revenue. This list is crucial for launching targeted loyalty programs and personalized marketing campaigns to retain these key clients.

3. Product Category Performance
sql
SELECT 
    category_name,
    SUM(revenue) AS category_revenue
FROM bike_stores
GROUP BY category_name
ORDER BY category_revenue DESC;
üü¢ Insight: Revealed which product categories (e.g., Mountain Bikes, Road Bikes) are the biggest revenue drivers. This analysis helps in making informed decisions about inventory procurement, marketing focus, and sales strategies.

4. Analyzing Sales Trends Over Time
sql
SELECT 
    DATE_FORMAT(STR_TO_DATE(order_date, '%m/%d/%Y'), '%Y-%m') AS month,
    SUM(revenue) AS monthly_revenue
FROM bike_stores
GROUP BY month
ORDER BY month;
üü¢ Insight: Uncovered clear monthly sales trends and seasonal patterns. This information is vital for:

Inventory Planning: Ensuring stock levels meet anticipated demand.

Budgeting & Forecasting: Setting realistic sales targets for future months.

Promotional Planning: Timing marketing campaigns to capitalize on peak seasons.

5. Store Performance Comparison
sql
SELECT 
    store_name,
    SUM(revenue) AS store_revenue
FROM bike_stores
GROUP BY store_name
ORDER BY store_revenue DESC;
üü¢ Insight: Compared the revenue generated by each store location. This highlights top-performing stores (whose strategies can be replicated) and underperforming ones (which may need additional support or investigation).

6. Top-Selling Products Analysis
sql
SELECT 
    product_name,
    SUM(total_units) AS units_sold,
    SUM(revenue) AS product_revenue
FROM bike_stores
GROUP BY product_name
ORDER BY product_revenue DESC
LIMIT 10;
üü¢ Insight: Pinpointed the top 10 products by revenue. This is essential for:

Inventory Management: Prioritizing stock for high-demand items.

Strategic Promotion: Featuring best-sellers in marketing materials.

Supplier Relations: Strengthening relationships with suppliers of these products.

7. Brand Performance Evaluation
sql
SELECT 
    brand_name,
    SUM(revenue) AS brand_revenue
FROM bike_stores
GROUP BY brand_name
ORDER BY brand_revenue DESC;
üü¢ Insight: Ranked brands by their total revenue contribution. This analysis is key for evaluating brand partnerships, negotiating terms with suppliers, and deciding which brands to promote more heavily.

Run the queries:

Open the BikeStores_Analysis.sql file in your MySQL client.

Execute the queries sequentially to see the results.

‚úÖ Conclusion
This SQL case study demonstrates the ability to:

Write efficient, clear SQL queries to solve business problems.

Translate data into actionable insights across multiple business domains (sales, marketing, operations).

Think critically about the strategic implications of data findings.

These skills are directly applicable to roles in Data Analysis, Business Intelligence, and MIS Reporting.
